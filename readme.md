# Examples for the Cinder Seminar @ Frown


## OS X

For the code to compile, we first need to change a user defined setting named "CINDER_PATH"
that can be found in each project's Build Settings and is shown below: 

![Cinder Path](/readmeAssets/CINDER_PATH.png) 

In there, we must put the relative path that takes us from the location of the .xcodeproj to the Cinder folder that is show below:

![Cinder Folder](/readmeAssets/CinderFolder.png) 

You might also need to change the Base SDK
